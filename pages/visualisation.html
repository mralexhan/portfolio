                Visualising Biodiversity was a design project mixing data visualisation and communication design. 
                    In this project, I chose to highlight the effects food agriculture has on the terrestrial biodiversity of Australia
                    to help people understand how foods they eat may affect the wildlife of the country. 
                    <br><br>
                    For the data visualisation, line graphs were used to highlight the correlation between food agriculture and biodiversity. 
                     An interactive choropleth map was also created so users can see areas where farmland of different food products overlap with the habitats of 
                     threatened wildlife. The data was found on publicly available sources and collated and organised in Microsoft Excel.
                    <br><br>
                    In order to present the data and ideas, a simple website was created through HTML and CSS, with the interactive graphs being
                    programmed through the Plotly.js library. Careful attention was to the usability and readability of the website, with user testing
                    being conducted to make sure the core concept was being properly communicated.
