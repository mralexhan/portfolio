                StudBud was a Frontend Web Design project focused on helping students manage their study time. 
                    The project consisted of designing, then programming a web application from the ground up. 
                    First, the functionalities of the web app were decided upon. These were informed by the results of user research
                 into the selected target audience in the form of surveys and online ethnographies conducted. Next, sketches and wireframes were made that fleshed out the
                    details of the layout and defined the flow of the web app. Finally, a mockup was created that finalised the web app's colours and visuals.

                       Before the programming began,  a functional specification sheet was created to detail which functions 
                       needed to be on the web app and prioritise their importance. This was crucial in deciding how to split up the 
                       work in the limited time that was given. I began with coding the look of the web app through HTML and CSS, 
                       keeping responsive web design in mind so the app could work on both desktop and mobile. I then programmed 
                       the functionalities of the web app through Javascript, which included a kanban board, a pomodoro timer, a 
                       music player, and local storage capabilities.</p>
