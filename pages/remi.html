                ReMi was a UI focused design project that aimed to help students better organise their study materials, whether
                    they be in-class (ex.textbooks) or out-of-class resources (ex. YouTube videos). The concept consists of an online library where
                    users would be able to easily find and save resources they find to be useful in a extendable sidebar.
                    <br><br>
                    The design was first ideated in sketches, then fleshed out in wireframes and mockups. To test the usability of the website,
                    as well as the overall effectiveness of the concept, a click-through prototype was created through Figma, which was then subject
                    to various usability tests. 
                    <br><br>
                    These usability tests included both expert-based heuristic testing and standard user testing. The results of these tests were collated
                    and synthesised into actionable changes that could be made to the website. Several rounds of usability tests were performed to trim out or fix unnecessary or clunky features.
