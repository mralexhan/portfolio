                The AI Interviewer was a proof of concept prototype created to demonstrate the possibility of an interview held by an AI assistant and its potential use cases.
                <br><br>
                The design consisted of a two primary parts. The first was the virtual avatar who would serve as the interviewer the user would see. The second was a report and database
                 which the company can use to compare candidates with each other.
                <br><br>
                The virtual avatar was generated by calling an API to an AI avatar service, which would automatically animate a speaker's movements based on a given prompt. When users speak 
                to this avatar, the speech is processed by calling the OpenAI API, which would then send back an appropriate response. The prompt was carefully edited to ensure appropriate 
                speech behaviour.
                <br><br>
                When the interview ends, a report would be generated summarising the user's performance based on a predetermined scoring rubric. This data would then be stored to a 
                database which the company can use to compare candidates.</p>
