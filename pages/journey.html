                A Journey in Transit was a UX focused design project that aimed to spread public awareness of Indigenous cultures within Sydney. 
                To achieve this goal, our group designed an interactive bus stop as well as an AR enhanced bus ride that would teach commuters 
                little tidbits of cultural information as they passed through different areas of Sydney.
                <br><br>
                This design was informed by in-depth primary research of various stakeholders held through questionnaires, pop-ups, and focus 
                groups, as well as market analysis of other solutions tackling the same problem space. 
                <br><br>
                This research was followed up by the creation of mid-fidelity physical prototypes created 
                through wood and cardboard. We used this prototype to conduct several rounds of user testing, where we gained valuable feedback 
                on bus stop screen UI, spatial considerations for the user, and overall effectiveness of the concept.
                <br><br>
                The project was capped with the creation of a to scale high-fidelity prototype of the interactive bus stop screen and AR bus 
                window, achieved through projectors, a simple web app, and custom made animations.</p>
