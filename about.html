            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi! My name is Alex Han. I graduated from the University of Sydney with a Bachelor's of Design Computing. 
                I was born in the United States, but grew up in Taiwan in a bilingual environment, making me fluent in both English and Mandarin Chinese. 
                Through self study and interaction with native speakers, I have also developed my Japanese to a conversational level.
                <br><br>
                Over the years, I've had the opportunity to participate in several internships across the world, honing my design skills in a professional context. Companies I've 
                interned at include Deloitte and Zero One Tech in Taipei, Jetabroad in Sydney, and Little Adam Inc from Shanghai (remotely).
                <br><br>
                I have a strong passion for learning and I try to broaden my experiences whenever I can. Over the years, I've volunteered for various groups, including 
                the Rotary Club, Keelung for a Walk, Oki Olive, and the Founder Institute.
                <br><br>
                Professionally, I hope to use my experiences to develop better user experiences and to work towards a more sustainable future for the world.
